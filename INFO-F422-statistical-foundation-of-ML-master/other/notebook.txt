real data


# Dataset :

get from kaggle, google data, ml repository
generate dataset yourself

importance of feature choice

example : handwritten image in pixel
feature will be : covering of black pixel in image, symmetry of pixel along y axis, etc.


# analysis

number of parameters that has to be learned

comparison with linear model. If you cannot do better than linear model you have a problem.

overfitting. If you have small dataset dont use too much parameters. risk of overfitting. perfect model wich seperate noise is very bad (overfitting). Watch lecture 4.

other parameter. Example leraing rate for perceptron. What good value ? Use validation set. In oreder to fix the right value. 
test set. you dont use the during training and you dont use them in validation. 

theory of generalisation : in wich situtation you can generalise. what parameter you have to learn. You must have at least 10 times more vc than ???

Bias variance tradeoff. i have 10 diff trainin set. If i only use few parameter. i cannot find the
